# NFDI4DS Hackathons at ZB MED

<img src="./nfdi4ds_zbmed.gif" alt="NFDI4DS / ZB MED"/>

Hackathons offer a space to create and develop ideas in a fast-paced collaborative environment during a couple of days. As part of the [NFDI4DS](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/) project, [ZB MED](https://www.zbmed.de/en/) organizes hackathons around subjects related to metadata for research artifacts. We use these pages as an entry point where people can find more information about them.
