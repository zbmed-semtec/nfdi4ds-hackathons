# NFDI4DS hackahtons at ZB MED in 2024

## Webby FDOs with RO-Crates and FAIR Signposting
- When: 2024.11.20 to 2024.11.22 from noon to noon
  - Tutorial on Wednesday afternoon
  - Hackathon on Thursday and Friday, finishing around noon
- Where: ZB MED in Cologne
- What: Let’s meet together to learn about and use webby [FDOs](https://fairdo.org/) with [RO-Crates](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) and [FAIR Signposting](https://signposting.org/). Depending on participants and interests, we will create hacking teams. At the end of the hackathon, teams will present their achievements. All slides will be collected and deposited in Zenodo, with links to repositories as it fits. Possible activities during the hackathon include:
  - Bring your own data and apply RO-Crates and FAIR Signposting to turn them into webby FDOs
  - Is there no profile in RO-Crate/Bioschemas that fits your needs? Let’s discuss and suggest a draft one
  - Help us design and create a webby FDO operations manager so FDO operations are supported on top of your webby FDOs to turn them into machine-actionable knowledge units
  - Propose your own topic
