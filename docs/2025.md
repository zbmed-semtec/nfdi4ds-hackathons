# NFDI4DS hackahtons at ZB MED in 2025

## Metadata with Schema.org for Training Materials

This hackathon is organized in collaboration with [DiscoRSE](https://www.discorse.de/) and [Quadriga](https://www.quadriga-dk.de/).

DiscoRSE aims to improve the use of RSE-OER in four distinct categories: making it easier for Research Software Engineers (RSEs) to find Open Educational Resources (OER) on specific topics, defining learning paths, improving visibility of authors, and finding OERs according to accessibility requirements.

Quadriga Competence Center creates meeting places for society, politics and administration to collect, process, use and analyze data in an increasingly digitalized world, while providing researchers at all career levels with resources for the confident handling of data.

- When: 2025.06.23 to 2025.06.25 from noon to noon
- Where: ZB MED in Cologne
- What: 
  - Day 1 (half day, starting around 13:00)
    - Introductions including information on the corresponding training platform and metadata approach in use.
    - Finding common grounds across the different platforms and metadata approaches (and possible alignment to FAIR and beyond –e.g., reproducibility, transparency, sustainability)
  - Day 2 (full day)
    - Continuation - Finding common grounds across the different platforms and metadata approaches (and possible alignment to FAIR and beyond –e.g., reproducibility, transparency, sustainability)
    - Creating a metadata schema, based on schema.org, for the common core across training platforms. We will use a crosswalk template for this. We intend to publish all crosswalks as a deposition in Zenodo with all participants as co-authors. We aim at presenting these results to NFDI Section EduTrain and the Base4NFDI project RDMT4NFDI, looking for further awareness and adoption
    - (Optional) Discussion/work on other topics of interest brought by the participants
  - Day3 (half day, finishing around 12:00)
    - Writing a final report to be deposited in Zenodo. 
    - Discussion on how to continue with the effort.

## Bioschemas hackathon

This hackathon is organized in collaboration with Nick Juty and Phil Reed from the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), Helena Schnitzer from [Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en), [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/), Ginger Tsueng from the [Su Lab](https://sulab.org/), and Alban Gaignard from the [University of Nantes](https://www.univ-nantes.fr/).

- When: 2025.06.25 to 2025.06.27 from noon to noon
- Where: ZB MED in Cologne
- What: Let’s meet together to 
  - improve [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/) and [Schemas.science](https://schemas.science/) websites based on [open GitHub issues](https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Awebsite)
  - improve or add tutorials on how to use Bioschemas and its specifications
  - improve or propose profiles, for instance there is some interest in reviewing the alignment between [ComputationalTool](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalTool/1.0-RELEASE) and [bio.tools metadata schema](https://biotools.readthedocs.io/), creating a profile for [FAIR4ML](https://w3id.org/fari4ml), creating a profile for [Croissant ML](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant/blob/main/docs/croissant-spec.md)
  - add Bioschemas/schemas.org markup to your own resource


To participate in this hackathon, please submit your application no later than 2025.06.15 to [Oxford Abstracts Webby FDOs](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/78918/submitter). There is limited capacity for participation. Please be aware that you will have to cover your own expenses (travel, food, and so on). 


## Research Software Metadata and nfdi.software hackathon

This hackathon is co-organized with the [Research Software Metadata Working Group](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10036379) of the [NFDI Section Metadata](https://www.nfdi.de/section-meta/), and the [NFDI Base project nfdi.software](https://base4nfdi.de/projects/nfdi-software). 

- When: 2025.07.17 to 2025.07.18 from noon to noon
- Where: ZB MED, Cologne
- What: Hackathon to create/complete and discuss crosswalks for software metadata with Codemeta as a starting point. Activities:
  - Choose or add a metadata schema (including standards, vocabularies, ontologies) or a platform (e.g., Research Software Directory) from a pre-selected list and then follow the instructions from a crosswalk template that will be provided.
  - In addition to the metadata crosswalk, we also want to identify which metadata elements relate to FAIR4RS and quality indicators. Related work to this topic can be found at [Ensure Software Quality](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10723608), see Section 6 and, in particular, Table 16.
